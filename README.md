#Detailed explaination of the project
In this project, we use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to perform URL classification. We begin by preprocessing the dataset to prepare it for use in the LSTM model. This involves tokenizing the input text data, padding the sequences to a fixed length, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. We then construct an LSTM model using the Keras deep learning library and train it on the training set. During training, we monitor the model's performance on both the training and testing sets to ensure that it is not overfitting to the training data.
After training the model, we evaluate its performance on the test set and analyze the results. Specifically, we examine the confusion matrix to evaluate the model's precision. We also analyze the training history of the model to understand its convergence behavior and identify any potential issues with the training process.
Overall, the results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of LSTM models for text classification tasks and highlight the importance of careful preprocessing and evaluation of deep learning models. This study also provides insights into the use of LSTM models for web security applications and suggests avenues for future research in this area.
